Quantitative Safety-Driven Co-Synthesis of CPS Implementations

This project implements the logical framework and optimization pipeline described in the paper "Quantitative Safety-Driven Co-Synthesis of Cyber-Physical System Implementations."

It relies on simulated results for the highly specialized algorithms (Reachability Analysis and Schedulability Tests) based on the data published in the paper's Tables to demonstrate the core co-synthesis process (Algorithm 1).

Execution

The main execution script is examples/varying_period_case.jl.

To run the optimization:

Initialize the Julia environment (as per the prompt).

Start the Julia REPL in the project root.

Run the example file:

include("src/CPSCoSynth.jl") # Compile module
include("examples/varying_period_case.jl") # Run optimization
